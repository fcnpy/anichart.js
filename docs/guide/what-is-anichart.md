# What is Anichart.js?

Anichart.js is a data visualization animation framework for developers. This framework allows you to quickly create dynamic data visualization videos.  Charts such as maps, bar charts, graphs, and pie charts are already supported.  The API provided by Anichart can also be customized or combined to suit your needs.

::: warning
For developers means there is a certain threshold to use it. In particular, you need some front-end development experience. You should know some development tools, such as NPM or Yarn, and an understanding of the basic syntax of JavaScript or TypeScript.
